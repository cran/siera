## Introduction to cards/cardx

`cards` and `cardx` are reputable R packages, part of the `pharmaverse`, which wrap statistical procedures and deliver Analysis Results Datasets (ARDs). 

Read more about `cards` [here](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/latest-tag/), and `cardx` [here](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/latest-tag/). 

## Using `cards` and `cardx` in ARS metadata

A powerful aspect of the ARS model, is that dynamic code can be supplied as part of the metadata and be evaluated on either 1. the Output level, 2. the Analysis level, or 3. the AnalysisMethod level. In an insightful insightful PHUSE paper by Richard Marshall [here](https://www.lexjansen.com/phuse-us/2025/ds/PAP_DS09.pdf), he explains how dynamic code can 'drive' automation in the ARS model by categorising it into 5 "geARS". 

"Gear 5" entails making use of the _AnalysisMethodCodeTemplate_ and _AnalysisMethodCodeParameters_ classes in the metadata.  The user supplies dynamic R code (with the option of making use of parameters referring to metadata pieces), which will be executed to perform the relevant AnalysisMethod operations.  

### Example: `ard_continuous`
For the `siera` package,  the R code used in _AnalysisMethodCodeTemplate_ is aligned with the _cards_ and `cardx` package. Below is a simple example of how a function _ard_continuous_ from the _cards_ package is used in the _AnalysisMethodCodeTemplate_ class:

```{r cards example, eval=FALSE}
# example of 'cards' code in AnalysisMethodCodeTemplate, using the ard_continuous function:

Analysis_ARD = ard_continuous(
  data = filtered_ADSL,
  by = c(byvariables_here),
  variables = analysisvariable_here
)
```

In the above example of _AnalysisMethodCodeTemplate_ code for a particular AnalysisMethod (summary statistics for a continuous variable), the _ard_continuous_ function from the _cards_ package is used.  Notice, however, that two parameters are used in the code: 

1. 'byvariables_here', and 
2. 'analysisvariable_here'.  

These are example placeholder names, to be replaced by actual variables, depending on the context for the Analysis.  For example, 'byvariables_here' could be replaced by TRT01A, and 'analysisvariable_here' could be replaced by AGE, for an ARD with summary statistics on AGE by Treatment.  The same code, however, will be reused for summary statistics on e.g. HEIGHT for another Analysis, and the 'analysisvariable_here' will be replaced with HEIGHT.  All this is dynamically applied within the `readARS()` function when generating R scripts using _siera_.  Let's see, for example, how the above statement would be auto-populated with actual objects (from the ARS metadata):

```{r cards example output, eval=FALSE}
# example of 'cards' code in AnalysisMethodCodeTemplate, populated with AnalysisMethodCodeParameters:

Analysis_ARD = ard_continuous(
  data = filtered_ADSL,
  by = c(TRT01A),
  variables = AGE
)
```

In order to facilitate the use of placeholders and their replacement with actual values from the metadata, several "constructs" have been defined in the _readARS_ function, and are available to the user to call from the _AnalysisMethodCodeTemplate_ and _AnalysisMethodCodeParameters_ classes in the metadata.  These constructs are either simple variables or datasets defined in the metadata, or complex, dynamic constructs from various metadata pieces, to be inserted in specific _cards_ functions, or pre-processing steps.  A list of defined constructs and examples is shipped with this package, and can be accessed with:

```{r cardsconstructs, eval=FALSE}
ARS_example("cards_constructs.xlsx")
```
