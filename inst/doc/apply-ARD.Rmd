## Using ARDs: Options

An Analysis Results Dataset (ARD) has multiple uses.  Consisting of machine-readable results (as opposed to static RTF or PDF results), examples of ARD use cases are:

- QC datasets
- re-using results for different outputs, e.g. figures or tables
- re-using results for various reporting events 
- creating final TFLs

### Downstream R packages for table creation

Two reputable R packages, part of the [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) have an ARD-first approach to creating tables:

- [`tfrmt`](https://github.com/GSK-Biostatistics/tfrmt)
- [`gtsummary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/)

Below are presentations delivered at posit::conf 2025 on these packages:

- [tfrmt](https://posit-conf-2025.github.io/pharmaverse/slides/05-tables-tfrmt/#/title-slide)
- [gtsummary](https://posit-conf-2025.github.io/pharmaverse/slides/06-tables-gtsummary/#/title-slide)
